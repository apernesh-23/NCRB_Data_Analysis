# NCRB_Data_Analysis

📊 Data Analysis Project with Python

A complete end-to-end Data Analysis Project focused on transforming raw data into meaningful insights using Python.
This repository contains the full Jupyter Notebook, processed dataset, and a well-documented report (PDF) for showcasing the workflow, techniques, and results.

🚀 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

Load and explore the dataset

Clean and preprocess raw data

Perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Apply feature engineering techniques

Generate visual insights using Python libraries

Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in data cleaning, statistics, analytical thinking, and Python-based data visualization.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

Python

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

🔍 Detailed Workflow
1️⃣ Data Ingestion

Imported dataset using pandas

Inspected initial structure (head(), info(), shape())

Identified missing values and data types

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values (drop/impute)

Performed datatype corrections

Standardized inconsistent entries

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Created new columns if required

Transformed categorical values

Performed binning / encoding

Extracted useful patterns

4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Univariate, bivariate & multivariate analysis

Visual plots:

Histograms

Boxplots

Countplots

Bar charts

Correlation heatmap

5️⃣ Insights & Interpretation

Identified patterns, trends, and anomalies

Derived meaningful insights

Connected patterns to possible business decisions

6️⃣ Report Generation

A detailed PDF report was created that includes:

Project objective

Step-by-step methodology

Code summary

EDA highlights

Final recommendations

Scikit-learn (if used) – modeling / preprocessing

Jupyter Notebook – analysis environment
